# Onion Architecture 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Onion Architecture Repository! This repository is a template and example for implementing the Onion Architecture in your software projects. Onion Architecture is a software design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and helps create maintainable and testable applications. This README will guide you through the structure and usage of this repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [ ] .NET Core SDK (version 3.1 or higher)
- [ ] Your favorite code editor (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onion-architecture-repo.git
   ```

2. Open the solution in your preferred development environment.

3. Build the solution to restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project OnionArchitecture.Web
   ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Project Structure

The repository follows the Onion Architecture pattern, which is organized into concentric circles of increasing abstraction and dependency, with each layer serving a specific purpose:

- **OnionArchitecture.Core**: This layer contains the core application logic and domain entities. It is at the center of the onion and has no dependencies on other layers.

- **OnionArchitecture.Infrastructure**: The infrastructure layer provides implementations for data access, external services, and other technical concerns. It depends on the core layer but has no dependencies on higher-level layers.

- **OnionArchitecture.Application**: The application layer contains application-specific logic and orchestrates interactions between the core and infrastructure layers. It depends on the core and infrastructure layers.

- **OnionArchitecture.Web**: This is the presentation layer, which includes web controllers, views, and any user interface-related code. It depends on all the previous layers but doesn't have direct dependencies on external libraries or frameworks.

- **OnionArchitecture.Tests**: This folder contains unit tests for the core and application layers, ensuring that the business logic is functioning correctly.

## Usage

You can use this repository as a template for your own projects. Here are some guidelines on how to adapt it for your needs:

1. Replace all instances of "OnionArchitecture" with your project's name.

2. Customize the domain entities, application logic, and infrastructure components to fit your specific requirements.

3. Extend the application by adding controllers, views, and user interface elements as needed.

4. Write unit tests to cover critical parts of your application.

5. Update this README and other documentation to reflect your project's details and setup.
